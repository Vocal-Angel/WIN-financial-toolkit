## 💡 What's Inside

This toolkit includes two strategic calculators:

### 1. 🧮 WealthWizard  
Grow your money faster with monthly compounding.  
**Inputs:**  
- Initial amount  
- Monthly contribution  
- Annual interest rate  
- Years of saving  

### 2. 🎯 Retirement Planner  
This calculator helps you estimate how much you’ll need saved at retirement.
It adjusts your desired income for inflation and uses the Present Value of a Growing Annuity formula to calculate the total lump sum you’ll need, based on:

Your desired monthly income (in today’s terms)

The number of years in retirement

Annual inflation rate

Expected return on investments during retirement

📌 Formula Used
The tool applies the Present Value of an Increasing Annuity, using monthly compounding:

ini
Copy
Edit
PV = PMT × [1 - ((1 + g)/(1 + r))^n] / (r - g)
Where:

PV = total lump sum needed at retirement

PMT = desired monthly income adjusted for inflation

r = monthly return rate (annual ÷ 12)

g = monthly inflation rate (annual ÷ 12)

n = total number of months in retirement

🔍 Example Based on Your Inputs:
Monthly income (today’s value): £2,000

Inflation: 3%

Return: 4%

Retirement years: 23

Age at retirement: 67

Output:

Inflation-adjusted monthly income: ~£2,319

Required lump sum at retirement: ~£570,181
